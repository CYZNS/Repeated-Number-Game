About The Project

Repeated Number Game is a Windows Forms application designed to challenge your cognitive processing speed.

The concept is simple but addictive: The game generates a chaotic grid of random numbers and gives you a single target number. Your mission is to find every instance of that target hidden within the noise before the countdown timer hits zero.



✨ Key Features

⚡ Dynamic Grid Generation: No two rounds are ever the same. The grid is randomized every time you hit start.

⏱️ High-Stakes Timer: Integrated stopwatch mechanic that adds pressure and excitement.

🎯 Round Progression: Survive the rounds to keep playing.

🧠 Cognitive Training: Excellent for practicing quick visual scanning and pattern recognition.

🖥️ Classic UI: Built with the robust and responsive Windows Forms framework.
